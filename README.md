# rbtree
Red-black tree implementation augmented to efficiently calculate the sum of arbitrary functions for elements smaller than a given key (similarly to an order statistic tree). Based on the original implementation by Emin Martinian available at http://web.mit.edu/~emin/www.old/source_code/red_black_tree/index.html
